# BSL-V53
Python Brawl Stars server emulator for version 53

## How to play: ##

### Server ###
I use a zip server from BSDS that I modified which was made by [Ð¡razor](https://github.com/CrazorTheCat) and [risporse](https://github.com/risporce)

1: Download the server and extract it: https://github.com/LkPrtctrd/BSL-V53/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

2: Open terminal on your computer and go to server directory.

3: Type python Main.py and it's done, follow client instructions.

### Android Client ###
1: Download the APK here: https://www.mediafire.com/file/n7gptweb86ncf5a/com.bsl.v53-rev1.apk/file

2: Change redirectHost (and redirectPort if you need it) in the frida config (lib/armeabi-v7a/libBSL.c.so)

3: Enjoy playing BSL-V53!
